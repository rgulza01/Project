#### README.md under construction. Will be updated soon...


### Branch "feature-2" is the most recent branch.

## Use cases:
In the following section I present the use case diagram based on the initial requirements identified. The diagram has been used to get a bird's eye view of GF FLASK and provide a visualisation of the external and internal factors influencing the system, in addition to requirement gathering purposes of successive iterations and optimisations of GF FLASK, following A/B testing.

## User stories 
I have worked in differnet iterations to implement product features, based on their values, for a better understanding of why users might want a certain functionality.

## Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)
Software projects are challenging due to the complexity of the product, nonlinear scaling of resources, measurement of project and product, initial uncertainty in project and product scope, and knowledge gained as a project evolves. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a type of measurement system used to assess the maturity level of a particular technology.  By the completion of the project, STSTEM is at TRL 4, see table below:
