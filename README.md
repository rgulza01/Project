### Branch "feature-2" is the most recent branch.

## Use cases:
In the following section I present the use case diagram based on the initial requirements identified. The diagram has been used to get a bird's eye view of GF FLASK and provide a visualisation of the external and internal factors influencing the system, in addition to requirement gathering purposes of successive iterations and optimisations of GF FLASK, following A/B testing.
